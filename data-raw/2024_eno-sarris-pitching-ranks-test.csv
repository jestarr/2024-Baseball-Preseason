The bet is that at least one of these things will be answered in the affirmative. Even if they aren’t, Strider was the third-best fantasy pitcher in 2023, despite the ERA.",NA,131.2,186.2,NA,21,3

A strong health grade, top-of-the-line stuff, and a large enough arsenal that he could still tweak for whiffs if he wanted — these are reasons to believe.

The park is one the hardest out there, the division is difficult, he lost a tick on his fastball last season, and he showed his worst whiff and strikeout rates since he became the beast he’s been since 2018. All that said, he increased the use of his cutter and curve, which offered fewer whiffs but reduced his oft-difficult home run rate — maybe some of it was on purpose.

His strikeout rate is slightly better than it looks if you use K/9 (it's actually easily above-average among starters), his walk rate is elite and his league-leading-type extension helps his stuff play up to the hitter.

Strangely, he barely struck out more batters than average last season. In the lower minors, he had way better strikeout rates, and his second-half strikeout rate was higher than his first-half one, so there's a chance that natural regression and progression will help his case there.

During that struggle, Keller was mostly living with his hard pitches — he threw his cutter, sinker, four-seam and slider 95 percent of the time in the latter months.

70,Dean Kremer,BAL,1,A,175.918,4.62,0.2,95.6,101.7,100.1,"Kremer's four-seamer and cutter provide a strong foundation. 95 mph with good ride on the fastball, and an 89 mph cutter with good cut — that works. His curveball, changeup, and sinker are all pretty meh, though, at least judged by their physical characteristics and whiff rates. By results, the curve was his worst pitch, but he's throwing that harder and harder, and maybe there's some upside there. He threw 96 sweepers that Stuff+ liked, too. What makes him interesting is that he has two above-average pitches, a good home team and park, and four other pitches that he could improve that would change his true talent as a pitcher.",53.2,125.1,172.2,208,75,82
71,Kyle Harrison,SFG,2.92779301,C,135.803,4.2,0.258,89,98.2,97.4,"Ninety-four mph, with two-plane movement from the left side, means that Harrison's fastball is above-average. Stuff+ says it's his only above-average pitch — and batters seem to agree, as they've slugged .500+ on the rest of his offerings, while the .176 batting average and .379 slugging off the fastball are both good numbers. Any good pitching coach would be happy to start with that fastball, but it's a little weird that so many pitching coaches have had the chance to work with him as he's advanced to the big leagues, and they still haven't found a great secondary. Maybe converting the slurve to a sweeper could make it work, but you're probably asking for a new pitch for him to break out. That's something to look for in the spring!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
72,Luis Severino,NYM,1.98136783,F,140.669,4.07,0.221,102.2,102.4,101.4,"He's lost an inch of ride on the four-seamer, and the changeup isn't quite as good as it was before, but Severino hasn't lost all his stuff. There's still a 96-plus mph fastball with above-average ride, and an 85 mph slider with two-plane movement, set against at least average command. It turns out that Severino was tipping his pitches some last year, in all likelihood, and that could explain how such a small change in movement and velocity would produce such disastrous results. He's made a massive change in parks and will have new voices to listen to among the coaches, and this is a cheap enough price to see if he can bounce back.",NA,102,89.1,NA,41,220

By the second half of last season, Bradish figured out how: He made the four-seam more of a cutter (it always had those tendencies), started throwing the sinker regularly, and turfed the changeup, settling in with a four-pitch mix that basically all works off the slider. If the sinker is the primary fastball, he doesn't have an above-average fastball. But maybe the slider is the 'fastball' and that flaw doesn't matter if you look at the arsenal as a whole. He also represents a bit of a line where the pitchers start showing more warts.",NA,117.2,168.2,NA,179,5

It's hard to argue with the optics of the pitch or the .155 slugging percentage it allowed last year. The results against the cutter and four-seam, though, line up with the middling model numbers. Then you've got the low batting average on balls in play and the high strand rate, both traditional luck indicators that suggest regression is coming.
