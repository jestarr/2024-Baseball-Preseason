His health scorecard looks pretty good, too, so this is a strong place to start your staff. The risk comes from the park and the size of his arsenal, perhaps. In 2022, those things didn't matter as much, but they are facts, still. Could his changeup continue to improve? Could the defense behind him improve? Could his luck on batted balls improve? The bet is that at least one of these things will be answered in the affirmative. Even if they aren’t, Strider was the third-best fantasy pitcher in 2023, despite the ERA.",NA,NA,131.2,21,186.2,3

A strong health grade, top-of-the-line stuff, and a large enough arsenal that he could still tweak for whiffs if he wanted — these are reasons to believe. As an example, he had a top-three curve by Stuff+ and only threw it 18 percent of the time. He’s still got some tricks up his sleeve as he ages.",167,4,202,10,193.2,13

He's spent 490 days on the injured list in his career, 30 over the past two seasons. He’s has had six significant arm injuries. He also throws really hard. All that earns him an F on Zimmerman's health report card. In terms of on-field success, there's nothing to be concerned with.

Then, he set out to improve his slider, and added four inches of sweep and three inches of drop over his first two years, with almost no velocity drop. Done. Mid-season 2023, he turned his sights to his changeup, settling on a split-finger that featured more drop than his previous version. He really ramped up the usage of that pitch in the second half, and a 24.4 percent strikeout rate was his reward.

The Dodgers have also been sneaking in extra days of rest for their starters for a while, which reduces the innings upside.

What if he managed 160 innings, how good would be? He certainly could be a top-three starter in baseball, with his combination of two elite breaking balls and that high-velo, high-ride fastball.

The biggest question is about his health. Is he past those old injuries?

His strikeout rate is slightly better than it looks if you use K/9 (it's actually easily above-average among starters), his walk rate is elite and his league-leading-type extension helps his stuff play up to the hitter.

His command is fine, not a problem. His health looks good. His home park and team situation is good. That's why the ERA projection is so delectable. Strangely, he barely struck out more batters than average last season. In the lower minors, he had way better strikeout rates, and his second-half strikeout rate was higher than his first-half one, so there's a chance that natural regression and progression will help his case there.

In this case, Rodriguez learned to turf the bad cutter and throw the breaking balls harder, and he was great in the second half. A 2.58 ERA with a 24 percent strikeout rate and a seven percent walk rate — that's strong work.

All systems would be good going into this next season except there's still the matter of his lack of bulk and shaky injury history.

A career-high in strikeouts and a career-low in walk rate is a great combination. To pick the nits, none of his pitches is a standout killer of a pitch — his curve was pretty good by results, with an 18 percent whiff rate, but Stuff+ calls it average and it allowed a .160 isolated slugging percentage.

That loss inspired him to throw his changeup and curve more often together, and that wrinkle helped him to keep the ball on the ground — weakly hit, at that. It probably also led to the career-worst walk rate, as he traditionally commands the changeup poorly. While there's plenty of regression coming from an unsustainable batting average on balls in play, Snell got his slider back by the end of the season and can probably walk fewer people in the coming seasons.
