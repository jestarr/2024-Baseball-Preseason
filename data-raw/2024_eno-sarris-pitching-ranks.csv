His health scorecard looks pretty good, too, so this is a strong place to start your staff. The risk comes from the park and the size of his arsenal, perhaps. In 2022, those things didn't matter as much, but they are facts, still. Could his changeup continue to improve? Could the defense behind him improve? Could his luck on batted balls improve? The bet is that at least one of these things will be answered in the affirmative. Even if they aren’t, Strider was the third-best fantasy pitcher in 2023, despite the ERA.",NA,131.2,186.2,NA,21,3

Still, he did lose nearly a tick on the fastball and some whiffs, so it wasn’t all good news. A strong health grade, top-of-the-line stuff, and a large enough arsenal that he could still tweak for whiffs if he wanted — these are reasons to believe. As an example, he had a top-three curve by Stuff+ and only threw it 18 percent of the time. He’s still got some tricks up his sleeve as he ages.",167,202,193.2,4,10,13

Fair question, but Cole has a few things going against him. The park is one the hardest out there, the division is difficult, he lost a tick on his fastball last season, and he showed his worst whiff and strikeout rates since he became the beast he’s been since 2018. All that said, he increased the use of his cutter and curve, which offered fewer whiffs but reduced his oft-difficult home run rate — maybe some of it was on purpose.

He's spent 490 days on the injured list in his career, 30 over the past two seasons. He’s has had six significant arm injuries. He also throws really hard. All that earns him an F on Zimmerman's health report card. In terms of on-field success, there's nothing to be concerned with. He hasn't lost velocity; he even added a sweeper that helped cut his second-half ERA by a full run, and he's continued his excellence. But is there any concern about innings?",213.1,153,192,3,25,11

Then, he set out to improve his slider, and added four inches of sweep and three inches of drop over his first two years, with almost no velocity drop. Done. Mid-season 2023, he turned his sights to his changeup, settling on a split-finger that featured more drop than his previous version. He really ramped up the usage of that pitch in the second half, and a 24.4 percent strikeout rate was his reward.

The Dodgers have also been sneaking in extra days of rest for their starters for a while, which reduces the innings upside. But he's landed in a good spot for wins that also won't hurt him in terms of home runs, has a large arsenal and good command, and is 25 years old.

The difference between 2023 (when he was the eighth-best fantasy starter) and 2022 (when he was more of a top-30 guy) was about 50 innings. With a mostly clean health report card, and strong innings counts most other years, he’s probably a good bet for 175-plus innings, around 200 strikeouts and an ERA in the low threes.

It was quite the 80-inning coming-out party. Now he's projected as a top-ten, and he may deserve it. 96 mph with a bigger breaking ball, a nice hard gyro slider, and a changeup that looks better by results than by the models — that's a strong arsenal backed up by good command. But he's never crossed over 150 innings, and last year's results were so out of the norm he'd established that it's probably more prudent to build in some extra regression and reduce the expected innings output a little.

His average end-of-season result has been in the top 25 the past three seasons and he's finished as high as 10th.

Some won't touch Glasnow in drafts because of his well-earned F on the health card, but in just 120 innings last season he was the 24th-best starting pitcher. What if he managed 160 innings, how good would be? He certainly could be a top-three starter in baseball, with his combination of two elite breaking balls and that high-velo, high-ride fastball. That kind of volume seems impossible, maybe, but if you include the minor leagues, he's cleared 120 innings four times in the past 10 seasons.

He upped his velocity, added a sweeper (which made more sense for his arsenal than his old cutter), firmed up his changeup, and showed the most ride on his fastball in his career. The biggest question is about his health. Is he past those old injuries? He had three significant arm injuries and spent 189 days on the IL in his career, but he's been pretty clean over the past two seasons.

He switched to a true bullet-spin gyro slider that got better results. He got more drop out of his curve than he ever had. In the end, though, he was about the same as he was before. His strikeout rate is slightly better than it looks if you use K/9 (it's actually easily above-average among starters), his walk rate is elite and his league-leading-type extension helps his stuff play up to the hitter.

He's 28, so age isn't a huge concern yet. He's coming off the eighth-best fantasy season among starting pitchers last year. He's got a clean bill of health.

But all that sweat and those homers and walks … they were out of form for him, and only amounted to a 12-inning road bump. What really happened last year is that the lefty ramped up usage of an improving cutter and showed the best velocity of his career — that turned into the best whiff rate and second-best strikeout rate of his career. While that did cost him some grounders, fantasy players will prefer the strikeouts. Feel good about the floor here, especially if you went bat-heavy early in your draft.",134.2,201.1,198,42,24,18

His command is fine, not a problem. His health looks good. His home park and team situation is good. That's why the ERA projection is so delectable. Strangely, he barely struck out more batters than average last season. In the lower minors, he had way better strikeout rates, and his second-half strikeout rate was higher than his first-half one, so there's a chance that natural regression and progression will help his case there.

But his early-season struggles (a first-half ERA over seven) reminded us that even the best prospects still have to adjust to the big leagues. In this case, Rodriguez learned to turf the bad cutter and throw the breaking balls harder, and he was great in the second half. A 2.58 ERA with a 24 percent strikeout rate and a seven percent walk rate — that's strong work.

In the second half, he featured his changeup more and threw his slider harder and with more drop. He was rewarded with a 2.81 ERA and the best strikeout-to-walk ratio among starting pitchers. All systems would be good going into this next season except there's still the matter of his lack of bulk and shaky injury history. If you drafted a bulk guy first and want to take a shot at a high-strikeout second starter, he's a great pick. If you need a late ace, it works, but try a bulk guy second.",144.1,78,165.2,13,64,23

A career-high in strikeouts and a career-low in walk rate is a great combination. To pick the nits, none of his pitches is a standout killer of a pitch — his curve was pretty good by results, with an 18 percent whiff rate, but Stuff+ calls it average and it allowed a .160 isolated slugging percentage.

That loss inspired him to throw his changeup and curve more often together, and that wrinkle helped him to keep the ball on the ground — weakly hit, at that. It probably also led to the career-worst walk rate, as he traditionally commands the changeup poorly. While there's plenty of regression coming from an unsustainable batting average on balls in play, Snell got his slider back by the end of the season and can probably walk fewer people in the coming seasons.

It's just too bad that he was plagued with health issues last season, ranging from breaking his toe in spring, to bursitis in the elbow, to shoulder inflammation at the end of the season — with a trip to the altitude in Mexico City as an inflammatory factor.

That fastball, plus a strong curve and change combo, pushed him to a 29 percent strikeout rate and a tidy 3.47 ERA in 96 innings. His results weren't quite as good in September, when his ERA approached four and his walk rate jumped, but there's a little upside left: He's tinkering with his cutter and a hard slider, with the latter being relatively new.

That's it! His slider drops maybe a half-inch more than it used to, he's using the sinker less, but functionally, it looks like just one mph separates 2021 and what came after. At 26 years old, maybe that's not something we need to worry about since velocity loss really starts around 30.

But he didn't turn that stuff or those whiffs into strikeouts like he used to, and every fly ball seemingly turned into a homer. The theory here is that the balky back (and forearm strain) that kept him off the field also hurt his command on the field when he was out there.

The spin is still there, the stuff is still there, the strikeouts are still there, and given good health again (this past injury is actualy a repeat of one he had earlier in his career, before a good season in 2019), he can certainly put together 150+ innings of a good ERA.

Two above-average fastballs, a great sweeper, and a good hard slider, all rated above-average by Stuff+ — it's a full arsenal. Against lefties, he was a little bit more predictable. His walk rate spiked and he gave up two homers per nine innings. He's still got some work to do there, as the change doesn't seem great.

The scouting reports gave him poor command on the way up, and his fastball locations are probably a big part of the blame ... but he had a 99 Location+ on the fastball, and was above-average in that stat in September, his worst month, suggesting he's not far from putting it all back together and being more like the pitcher we saw in the first two months last year when he had a 3.61 ERA and a 29 percent strikeout rate.

His cutter got pounded when it got too soft, so he was sent to the minor leagues to recover that velo.

There's a chance he never quite comes through on the promise of that fastball — Taijuan Walker's fastball has been his best pitch his entire career — but it's enticing enough (along with stellar strikeout rates) to give him a shot here as we transition into starters with more question marks.",NA,NA,104.2,NA,NA,167

Maybe he should be higher, but it's worth pointing out that every ERA estimator has put Bassitt around a half-run higher than his on-field results, he's lost velocity in each of the past two offseasons (and this spring, yet again), and no projection system has him under a four ERA for next season. His breaking pitches grade out well and he throws a lot of pitches with good command, but as that velocity drops, his hard pitches (none of which registers over a 91 Stuff+) are going to get worse and worse.

Three years combined now, he's allowed a .679 OPS in the first half and a .757 in the second half. Those kinds of splits aren't normally predictive, but there's a reason here for the slides. Despite all that, he's been a top-40 fantasy starter in two of those years and useful in the other. Don't count on him for a full season of value.

His power bullet slider is also above average in velocity and outcomes. He doesn't seem to trust the changeup, and it doesn't get good results, so the real question is if the curveball can be the third pitch that helps him turn the lineup over. Batters hit .151 and slugged .288 off it last year, with above-average whiffs, so maybe the poor Stuff+ is missing something, or maybe it just works as a third alternative and shouldn't get more playing time.

He only stranded 69 percent of the batters that got on base, and that number has been 78 percent for his career, so there was some bad luck. He does look like someone who will give up homers, though, and that will keep his ERA above four, especially in Yankee Stadium. Then again, the league's ERA is over 4.30 now, so that's still valuable production, and it should come with more wins in 2024.

He can spin the ball well — he's always at the top of the RPM leaderboards — and spin ages well. He's 33, but it's not like he has a ton of mileage on his arm. I'm into Lugo.",NA,NA,146.1,NA,NA,52

The velo isn't plus, and he's throwing a sinker to opposite-handed hitters (who slugged .566 off it), so maybe a cutter or even an iffy four-seam could help.

A second half with an ERA two runs higher brought a lot of that breakout into question. During that struggle, Keller was mostly living with his hard pitches — he threw his cutter, sinker, four-seam and slider 95 percent of the time in the latter months. Other than the slider, his pitches are average-ish despite great velo, so his best attack plan is probably to bring the curve or change back in and mix velocities more.

He tried to replace some of those four-seamers with sliders, sinkers, and changeups, but those just aren't as good in a vacuum as his four-seamer and curve have been. Despite good velo, he's inching his way toward the same place that many other elite curveball guys eventually ended up — he can be brilliant on any given night, but he's more prone to bad stretches as his non-curve pitches deteriorate.",185.2,172,163.1,14,88,73

He seems likely to throw 150 innings, and the park and team situations are decent, so maybe I'll be missing out. But about half the time over his career, he's been a miss — fantasy-wise, at least.

Over the past five seasons, the highest walk rate (minimum 400 innings) is Blake Snell's 11 percent. The good news is that Cabrera’s fastball command (as judged by Location+) has improved in each of the past three seasons, and his slider command is around average. The overall command he showed last season is more viable by that stat: 13 starters have had a 97 Location+ and put together 250 innings over the past three seasons.

Just having a great four-seam and the ability to spin the ball is a great place to start. The big mystery is why he had an ERA over six at home. Some of it is luck (a much larger batting average on balls in play), but some of it is just weird (his strikeout rate was six points lower at home).

But with the postseason, we have those 22 innings of a proof of concept, which is to say that sinker he started throwing then looks like it makes him really good against righties, nearly dominant.

He should shove when he's on the field, but with 132 innings pitched in the past three seasons combined, he's an extreme volume risk. Pair him with a horse (or three) if you can.

Any good pitching coach would be happy to start with that fastball, but it's a little weird that so many pitching coaches have had the chance to work with him as he's advanced to the big leagues, and they still haven't found a great secondary. Maybe converting the slurve to a sweeper could make it work, but you're probably asking for a new pitch for him to break out. That's something to look for in the spring!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
74,Triston McKenzie,CLE,2.4,C,149,4.34,0.247,102,94,94,"McKenzie has had stretches of brilliance in his short career so far. A 2.70 ERA in the second half of 2022. A strong eight-start debut in the shortened 2020 season. Then he's had the other stretches, in which his ERA has been over five and his walk rate has exploded. The guess here is that it has to do with health. His velo was at its best in 2022, and last year, he couldn't command his fastball at all. There's a really good three-pitch mix in here spear-headed by a plus curveball, though, and if he's feeling good in the spring, he'll only move up this list.",120,191.1,NA,110,19,NA

He gave up a whopping .625 slugging on the pitch last year, so this is no model mirage. What Canning does have is a really good slider and changeup pairing, and the ability to command those pitches as well as the four-seamer. Mixing, matching and pitching backward will be the plan for the Angels righty, and it's worked for other pitchers before, but you'll want to be careful with him in certain matchups — and he may not get a ton of wins on that team this year.",62.2,NA,127,156,NA,83

Originally placed on the injured list for a biceps strain, a partial tear in his right lat extended his stay there. In the end, he only threw 18 innings. Supposedly healthy right now, the Marlins are still going to slow-walk his spring, so there's a chance he's behind when the games start. He's always had a good changeup and sinker combo, and has been searching for a good slider for a couple of years now, so it's not only health that's a question mark. The good news is that he has good command of all four of his pitches, and pitches in a great park. That shouldn't change.",133,107,NA,31,200,NA

The current strategy seems to be using the slider and four-seam equally in counts where he needs a strike, all in an effort to get to counts where he can throw the splitter for whiffs. At some point, he won't be able to hide that fastball any more and it will go kaput.

By the second half of last season, Bradish figured out how: He made the four-seam more of a cutter (it always had those tendencies), started throwing the sinker regularly and turfed the changeup, settling in with a four-pitch mix that basically all works off the slider. If the sinker is the primary fastball, he doesn't have an above-average fastball. But maybe the slider is the 'fastball' and that flaw doesn't matter if you look at the arsenal as a whole. Now, trying to use rest and rehab and an injection to recover from a UCL strain, he drops down to join the other major health risks with ace-like upside.",NA,117.2,168.2,NA,179,5

Both of his fastballs sat triple-digits and have the shape to service the inevitable velocity loss that comes with moving from the bullpen to the rotation, as the Giants have planned for Hicks this spring. His changeup and two breaking balls are model-pleasers, and his sweeper has been his go-to out of the pen. It's probably also unfair to say a pitcher with eight starts in the major has used up all his chances to start. But for this experiment to work, Hicks has to find some command he hasn't really shown in the past. None of his pitches had above-average locations last year, and that's in line with past results.

He's got a wider arsenal than A.J. Puk, at least, and more fastball command than Jordan Hicks. He's shown the ability to throw more innings than either guy, too. Why is he down here, then? Well, Atlanta can be an unforgiving park when it comes to homers, and that was part of why López was moved from the rotation to the bullpen in the first place. He's also had some fastball command issues in the past, so it's not really a strength.

The question is if he can command it all enough to come through on all the promise he showed as a prospect. Advanced metrics say he didn't command any of his pitches at an average rate, and neither his fastball (95 Location+) or slider (93 Location+) at a passable rate, even. This matches up with the grades many scouts put on him, too. The Dodgers give their starters tons of rest days and limit their innings potential, so the team context is not all positive.

Last year, his release point drifted up over the course of the season, and his ride came and went, and Javier's results mosty went. Late in the season, there were signs of life on the fastball, and he's dedicated himself to slimming down and recovering what he once lost. There's still a decent amount of risk with a player whose fastball velocity has been in decline for some time now and mostly only throws two pitches with below-average command — even if he recovers all the ideal shapes on his pitches.",101.1,148.2,162,63,16,102

His curveball, changeup, and sinker are all pretty meh, though, at least judged by their physical characteristics and whiff rates. By results, the curve was his worst pitch, but he's throwing that harder and harder, and maybe there's some upside there. He threw 96 sweepers that Stuff+ liked, too. What makes him interesting is that he has two above-average pitches, a good home team and park, and four other pitches that he could improve that would change his true talent as a pitcher.",53.2,125.1,172.2,208,75,82

Anybody drafting him would have to be happy to get 100 innings from the erstwhile ace, it seems. The good news for the pitcher and his fans is that while he's aged and his body has let him down more often, his strikeout rate has remained high, and he's been able to mix and match his (Three? Four?) breaking balls and his signature change with a fastball that still hovers above average in the velocity department. The bad news is that the nicks and cuts have cost him some breaking ball command, and that's led to more homers over time.

His sinker, sweeper, and curveball all move away from their barrels and can cause fits when he's right. Against lefties, though, he's searching for a plan that works. The Yankees righty has only had one above-average month against southpaws. He's never tried zeroing in on his best two pitches against them (the cutter and the curve) and turfing everything else, but maybe his cutter isn't good enough for that idea. His sweeper had a .750 slugging against lefties, and still he threw it because he felt he needed more wrinkles.

It's hard to argue with the optics of the pitch or the .155 slugging percentage it allowed last year. The results against the cutter and four-seam, though, line up with the middling model numbers. Then you've got the low batting average on balls in play and the high strand rate, both traditional luck indicators that suggest regression is coming. There's just a surprising amount of questions left for the 30-year-old who put up 166 1/3 innings with an ERA under three in his first season stateside.

He'd added a sweeper he was excited about and was de-emphasizing his four-seamer in favor of a cutter, and frankly it was a bit of a mess. In the second half, he returned to his bread and butter four-seamer, threw the curve more and the cutter less, and figured something out. Lefties only hit for a .695 OPS against him after July 1. Taillon may not have a ton of upside, but he does have three plus breaking balls and command of all five of his pitches.

Last year, he added a sweeper, and that worked for a while, but he struggled to command it, and it's not a great weapon against righties. This offseason, he altered his changeup grip (again) to try to get more drop, and refined a cutter. Given that he's headed to a pitcher's park (again) with a decent lineup behind him, he's got plus context.

That much is pretty much set in stone given pitcher injury rates and historical usage patterns. He's got a very nice four-seamer that he commands well, a decent cutter that he commands well, and a slider that could make the whole package hum. That gives him weapons against both lefties and righties, and while that's not a large arsenal, it looks like it can be an effective one.

That's from his manager, but the implication — that Houck is in good health — is a big one because the sidewinding righty is in line for the fifth starter spot on the team. He dominates right-handed hitters with his low slot sinker and slider combo that looks like a mirror image of Chris Sale, but he's been struggling to find either a cutter or splitter that works enough to get lefties out.

At times last year, Detmers was throwing three breaking balls (a sweeper, a hard gyro slider, and a curveball) and that's probably the best way for him to succeed despite the fastball that gave up a .291 batting average and a .505 slugging last season. The hard slider can be the one he throws for strikes, and then the other three pitches get mixed around that one as he tries to dance his way to excellence.

That gives him something he can do when he absolutely needs a strike. When he's got leverage in the count, he can blow you away with three excellent breaking balls and a high-velo, high-ride monster of a four-seamer.

Over the past two years we have a mid-threes ERA over 140 innings, so the results have been fine. This spring, the reports on his stuff have been good, and he's struck out six of the 18 batters he's faced as of this writing.

Once the model was revised to include platoon splits, his Stuff+ came down to earth, though, because he throws a cutter (better against opposite-handed hitters) and a sweeper (better against same-handed hitters) primarly. That makes him a one-pitch pitcher depending on the handedness of the batter. The curve and change that he's been fiddling with forever — he should throw them. No matter what the model says. They'll help keep the batter off balance and maybe get Ashcraft past the fourth- and fifth-inning stumbles that have hurt his ERA so much.

But he only threw one start last season before going down with the injury, so it seems like he could throw more than half of a season, and he'll do so in a good park for pitchers.

That four-seamer is a good foundation, as its easier to tweak shapes on secondary pitches than it is to change a pitcher's arm slot and make a big difference on their fastball shape. At 25 years old, with a fastball that's been holding velo (and is up so far this spring), and demonstrated above-average strikeout rates, Gore deserves more love (and better coaching) than he's gotten so far.",NA,70,136.1,NA,140,141
