His health scorecard looks pretty good, too, so this is a strong place to start your staff. The risk comes from the park and the size of his arsenal, perhaps. In 2022, those things didn't matter as much, but they are facts, still. Could his changeup continue to improve? Could the defense behind him improve? Could his luck on batted balls improve? The bet is that at least one of these things will be answered in the affirmative. Even if they aren’t, Strider was the third-best fantasy pitcher in 2023, despite the ERA.",NA,NA,131.2,21,186.2,3

Still, he did lose nearly a tick on the fastball and some whiffs, so it wasn’t all good news. A strong health grade, top-of-the-line stuff, and a large enough arsenal that he could still tweak for whiffs if he wanted — these are reasons to believe. As an example, he had a top-three curve by Stuff+ and only threw it 18 percent of the time. He’s still got some tricks up his sleeve as he ages.",167,4,202,10,193.2,13

All that earns him an F on Zimmerman's health report card. In terms of on-field success, there's nothing to be concerned with.

Then, he set out to improve his slider, and added four inches of sweep and three inches of drop over his first two years, with almost no velocity drop. Done. Mid-season 2023, he turned his sights to his changeup, settling on a split-finger that featured more drop than his previous version. He really ramped up the usage of that pitch in the second half, and a 24.4 percent strikeout rate was his reward.

But he's never crossed over 150 innings, and last year's results were so out of the norm he'd established that it's probably more prudent to build in some extra regression and reduce the expected innings output a little.

His strikeout rate is slightly better than it looks if you use K/9 (it's actually easily above-average among starters), his walk rate is elite and his league-leading-type extension helps his stuff play up to the hitter.

All systems would be good going into this next season except there's still the matter of his lack of bulk and shaky injury history.

It probably also led to the career-worst walk rate, as he traditionally commands the changeup poorly. While there's plenty of regression coming from an unsustainable batting average on balls in play, Snell got his slider back by the end of the season and can probably walk fewer people in the coming seasons.

His command is fine, not a problem. His health looks good. His home park and team situation is good. That's why the ERA projection is so delectable. Strangely, he barely struck out more batters than average last season. In the lower minors, he had way better strikeout rates, and his second-half strikeout rate was higher than his first-half one, so there's a chance that natural regression and progression will help his case there.
